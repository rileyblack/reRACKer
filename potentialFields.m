function T = potentialFields(qs, qf, cueballPos, chalkPos, rackPos)
%potentialFields calculates the total configuration space joint torque
%acting on reRACKer in a given scenario
%
%T = potentialFields(qs, qf, cueballPos, chalkPos, rackPos) where T
%is the outputted total configuration space joint torque in the form
%T = [T1, T2, T3]', qs is the inputted current manipulator configuration,
%qf is the inputted final manipulator configuration, cueballPos is the
%inputted cueball obstacle centroid position, chalkPos is the inputted
%chalk obstacle centroid position, and rackPos is the inputted rack
%obstacle centroid position. These manipulator configurations are 
%expressed in the form q = [ÆŸ1*, d2*, d3*], and the positions are expressed
%in the form Pos = [x, y, z] as coordinates relative to robot base.
