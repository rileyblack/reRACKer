function T = forceMapping(qs, Fatt1, Fatt2, Fatt3, Frep1, Frep2, Frep3)
%forceMapping maps workspace forces to configuration space forces for
%reRACKer in a given scenario
%
%T = forceMapping(qs, Fatt1, Fatt2, Fatt3, Frep1, Frep2, Frep3) where T is
%the outputted total configuration space joint torque produced by potential
%fields, qs is the inputted current configuration in the form 
%qs =[ÆŸ1*, d2*, d3*], Fatt1, Fatt2, and Fatt3 are the inputted attractive
%forces acting on joints 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and Frep1, Frep2, and
%Frep3 are the inputted repulsive forces acting on joints 1, 2, and 3,
%respectively.
